What?
====

GoCommando is a small command line utility helper that does the boring work when creating command line utilities in .NET.

More info coming soon at http://mookid.dk/oncode/gocommando

One day, maybe I'll tweet something as well... [@mookid8000][2]

How?
====

Create a new console application. `Install-Package GoCommando` to get the DLL, and then `Go.Run()` in the `Main` method.
